# brainfree auth

## description

When I started my brainfree project, it was clear to me that I would like to work with Keycloak. Since with Keycloak 17
came some new changes and I lack the time to deal with it in more depth. I had been looking for alternatives because a
lot of money costs, I decided to set up a small [Oauth2](https://auth0.com/docs/articles) project.
